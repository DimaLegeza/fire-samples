Gemfire, and the applications that use it are made up of serveral components. There is the data caching tier itself
that can exist as one or more data nodes.  The data tier can be extended to provide database write-behind, write-through
and on-demand read-through.  The data tier can also be replicated to remote data clusters through the WAN gateway. 
WAN replication is not currently part of this code base.  There is also a client tier that can be pure client or client with 
local caching.  Client applications can consume data as they wood a database or they can register for 
data change notifications with the appropriate callback handlers.  Gemfire relies on or can make use of other components 
including the Gemfire locator and JMXAgent. Gemfire clusters will almost always be be coordinated and linked through
the use of Gemfire locator processes.  JMXAgents add JMX bean access to a gemfire cluster for management and
monitoring through either GFMon or some other JMX monitoring tool.
<p>
Gemfire is a set of Java programs or modules.
Gemfire components can be run in as standalone programs using the scripts included with the Gemfire product download or they
can be run as part of some other executable. This demonstration provides support for running all of the PoC/demonstration
components as part of custom java main() executable or as via a WAR file.  The java main() programs provide
a simple testing framework for running inside Eclipse. The WAR files provide a method of deploying Gemfire components
in environments where all Java programs must run from inside a Java Servlet or J2EE container.

<h1>Functionality</h1>
This is a very basic demo of some of VMWare's Gemfire product.  
It is demonstrable as both standalone components and as deployable war files.  
The following is an incomplete list of demonstrated components.
<ul>
<li><b>Locator</b> A locator process that shows how the ports are selected</li>
<li><b>Server Cache nodes</b> A standalone data server or clustered server that includes listeners and continuous queries </li>
<li><b>Cache Client</b> A standalone client program that has local cache</li>
<li><b>Continuous Query Clients</b> A standalone client program that receives call backs when data changes in certain regions</li>
<li><b>WAN Gatway</b>A cluster node that could be used to replicate data to another site. It currently logs batch data inserts and updates as they become available from the cluster nodes.</li>
<li><b>Cache Listener</b> A component that runs in the server that logs listener events</li>
<li><b>Cache Loader</b> Two examples, one that just logs when there is a cache miss and the other that is configured to load cache misses form the demo H2 database.</li>
<li><b>Cache Writer (write-through)</b> Two examples, one that just logs when data changes in the cache and can be written some backend system. The other is configured to write to a DB when data is saved.</li>
<li><b>Replicated regions</b> Gemfire regions where the data is replicated across all nodes</li>
<li><b>JmxAgent</b> A JMXAgent wrapper that lets it be run in the same way as the other components.</li>
<li><b>Disk write-through persistence(?)</b> this may belong in a different section</li>
<li><b>Disk write-behind</b> hooks demonstrated via WAN gateway and a wan gateway listener</li>
<li><b>The @cacheable annotation</b> One of the commands and regions is dedicated the @cacheable annotation. See the "power" command</li>
<li><b></b> </li>
</ul>
<p>
Some things that are not yet in the demonstration
<ul>
<li><b>WAN Gateway</b> Basic Spring-Data-Gemfire configuration for a WAN gateway that is used, in this case, to log activity.</li>
<li><b>Write-behind</b> This is built on top of WAN gateway. The demonstration includes logging mostly because I couldn't use spring batch to do no code writes they way I could do reads</li>
<li><b>Write-through</b> The demonstration includes logging write-through. It will eventually have fully functional write-through </li>
<li><b>Partitioned regions</b> This requires that users run at least two nodes to be useful.</li>
<li><b>Co-located data</b> This is whose node location is picked based on its relationship to other data.  All regions are currently fully replicated without any partioning </li>
<li><b>Security hooks</b> TBA</li>
<li><b>Data morphing based on permissions</b> This is dependent on identity management.</li>
<li><b>Properties/meta-data region</b> An example of how gemfire can use gemfire itself to store cluster behavior information for java proceedures or listeners.</li>
<li><b></b> </li>
</ul>
<h1>Demonstration Components</h1>
<p>
<h2>Shell</h2>
The demo has a lightweight menu system available on stdin/stdout/log4j when running as standalone applications. The commands are available in client or server processes. 
The idea here is that we wanted a simple way to muck around with Gemfire features without building your own application. 
This list in this document may not always be up to date.  See the menu in the individual programs for the current list of available commands.
That command line lets you do the following functions:  
<ul>
<li>Save a note to the notes table.  Saves a command line entered note to the NOTES-REGION-WITH-GATEWAY table which is hooked to an asynchronous listener via the WAN gateway. <br>Usage: &lt;cmd&gt; &lt;double quoted message&gt;
<li>Generate 2^n as a demo of @Cacheable.  Calls a method that calculates 2^n and caches or uses a previously calculated value. 
    That method is marked with the @Cacheable annotation.
    Uses the cache version if you repeat the same number more than once.
    Cache entries expire 15 seconds after creation.  <br>Usage: &lt;cmd&gt; &lt;n&gt;
<li>Return Cache sizes for all regions. Clients with local caches return the local cache size   <br>Usage: &lt;cmd&gt;
<li>Create random data and stuff into Gemfire Cluster. This creates 400,000 rows in all tables    <br>Usage: &lt;cmd&gt;
<li>Load a region from a CSV file (absolute or relative to project root).   <br> Usage: &lt;cmd&gt; &lt;region_name&gt; &lt;csv_file_name&gt;
<li>Load data from DB pre-defined automapping assumes 1-1 mapping. Uses the Spring batch auto-binding layer    <br>Usage: &lt;cmd&gt; &lt;region_name&gt; 
<li>Load all possible regions from data from DB pre-defined automapping assumes 1-1 mapping. Runs one thread per region  <br>Usage: &lt;cmd&gt; 
<li>Modify a string attribute. Retrieves the object from the cache and changes its value.  <br> Usage: &lt;cmd&gt; &lt;region_name&gt; &lt;pk&gt; &lt;property_name&gt; &lt;attribute_name&gt;
<li>Retrieve entire <i>cacheName</i> and show the first <rowCount> entries (requires template). Calls toString()   <br> Usage: &lt;cmd&gt; &lt;cacheName&gt; &lt;showRowCount&gt;
<li>Retrieve all data in all Regions. Does not display. May run parallel fetch, one per region (uses templates)   <br> Usage: &lt;cmd&gt;
<li>Retrieve from <i>cacheName</i> the object specified by key <i>key</i>   <br> Usage: &lt;cmd&gt; &lt;cache_name&gt; &lt;key&gt;
<li>Rebalance cache. Only works on data/server node    Usage: &lt;cmd&gt;
<li>Set a property in the property region. Ex 'cacheWriterEnable|cacheLoaderEnable' 'true|false'.  Useful for testing properties.    <br>Usage: &lt;cmd&gt; &lt;property-name&gt; &lt;new-value&gt;
<li>Purge all data from cache: WARNING!    <br>Usage: &lt;cmd&gt;
<li>Exit this program without hesitation. Terminates command line programs   <br> Usage: &lt;cmd&gt;
</ul>
<h2>Executables</h2>
<p>
The system is broken up into several executables that exist as main() programs that can be run from inside Eclipse with <i>RunAs-->JavaApplication</i>.  
Some of these can be run as standalone java programs with their own bootstrap. The java application class files containing the main() entry point 
exist in demo.vmware.app to make it easier to explore.
These programs are all in the src/main/java/demo/vmware/app folder.
<ul>
<li><b>DB.java</b> This is a demonstration database that can be used to test bulk loading and cache-loader code when there is a cache miss.
Run this first if you have any of the loaders and listeners enabled.
<li><b>Locator.java</b> Run this to start your Gemfire locator that is required before any client or server can startup. 
This code supports an arbitrary number of locators per machine but is currently configured for 2 through spring wiring.
<li><b>Server.java</b> Run this to start a Gemfire server process. You can run multiple copies of this on the same machine.
The caches are configured through spring so you can convert the regions from simple replicated to partitioned though those files. 
The demo command menu is available in this process type.
<li><b>JmxAgent.java</b> GFMon, the Gemfire monitoring tool, communicates with a cluster via JMX.This program starts the gemfire/jmx bridge.  Run this agent before running gfmon. 
<li><b>Client.java</b> Clients can be standalone or caching clients.  This is a caching client that runs the same command menu as the server.
Clients should be launched after all the server and services components have been started.
<li><b>ClientCq.java</b> This is a standalone non-caching client that registers a continuous query for data changes of a certain type.
Clients should be launched after all the server and services components have been started.
<li><b>WanGatewayWritebehind.java</b> This runs a WAN gateway process that records all data that would either be written to a database
as database write-behind or data that would be replicated across the WAN gateway to another data center.  
Only the NOTES-REGION-WITH-GATEWAY region is currently configured for this so you must use the "add a note" command in a server or client to insert data that is sent to this process.
</ul> 

Server, Client, Locator and JmxAgent can also be run inside container using the separate war files defined in src/main/resources. 
The WAR files are built as part of the standard maven build.

<H1>Quick-Start Build & Demo</H1>

<ol>
<li>Download the code from github</li>
<li>Run <i>mvn clean install</i> to pull down all the dependencies and to build the class files and war packages.  You will not be deploying the war packages as part of this quick-start.
<li>Start the H2 database using DB.java.  This is optional if you disable or remove the database connected cache loaders.
<li>Connect to H2 on http://localhost:8082 and use the default login and password This can be done from inside Eclipse
<li>Paste the contents of src/test/resources/sql/create-tables.sql into the H2 command window and execute it. 
This creates the schema and loads a couple rows of test data. You could add 100s or 1000s of rows in the sql file to increase the DB size
<li>Start the locator using Locator.java. This can be done from inside Eclipse. 
<li>Start the server using Server.java as an java application.  This can be done from inside Eclipse.
<li>You run more than one server. Load will be distributed across them via the locators.
<li>Verify the size of each cache using the command console.  One of the commands prints the region sizes.
<li>Request an object in one of the regions by key after looking at the keys currently available in H2. 
The cache loader will fetch one row in.
<li>Load all of the tables from the database using the command console
<li>Verify the size of each cache.
<li>Look at the server logs to see what is going on. Logging levels are set in log4j.properties.
<li>Load some data from a csv using the command console.  The path is relative to the eclipse project root so it wold be src/test/resources/datafiles.
The filenames are not exactly the same as the region names so pay attention to that when entering the command. 
Logging level changes require a restart to be picked up.
<li>You can create a 2 million record cache through auto-generate command in the command console.
<li>Start a client
<li>You can pull down the 2 million rows down to the client via the command menu. It runs one thread per region about 13 seconds on a 2011 macbook.
<li>Pull down the content of one of the regions using the command console and have it print a couple objects using the command options.
<li>Start a continuous query (cq) client.  
<li>Modify one of the objects that is being monitored by the cq client and you should see it log the fact that it got a callback.
<li>Start the wan gateway write-behind process.
<li>Create a note using the note command on a server (or client).  Double quote the notes string to include spaces.
<li>Watch the logs on the WAN gateway to see the gateway pick up the created note.
</ol>

The cache listener and partitioning behavior can be changed via the files in the src/main/resources directory.  
You can leave the locator and datbase running across Server and Client restarts.

<H1>Demonstration data</H1>

<h2>Gemfire Regions</h2>
The gemfire regions exist to demonstrate a couple different ideas and capabilities.
<ul>
<li>Data Model Regions
    <ul>
    These were created for a specific demonstration and have self and cross reference joins that make them less than ideal candidates for partitioning.  
    Most data models have good breakpoints for partitioning. These regions are replicated across all nodes.
    All of the data loading and creation happens in these regions. These are the regions we created GemfireTemplates for.
    <li>ATTRIBUTE</li>
    <li>RELATIONSHIP</li>
    <li>ACTIVITYLEGAL</li>
    <li>CONTACT</li>
    <li>TRANSFORM.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>Properties regions.
    <ul>
    These regions act as meta-data for some of cluster-side custom code.  This lets us create state that can turn on and off
    features in our custom code. They can also be used for applicaton wide properties that might otherwise be pushed to 
    mulitple file systems or an RDB.
    <li>PROPERTIES</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>"Cache-able" regions.
    <ul>
    This codebase demonstrates how to use the @Cacheable annotation and how it can be used with gemfire to manage objects.
    This is a very easy way to push objects into and out of a cache without knowing the cache exists. All ther
    uses of the cache in this codebase "know" about the cache. 
    The example is very simple only using a single region. Applications could share types of objects in a single region
    or they could have one region per object type for these caches. 
    These tables have a 15 second TTL so entries expire 15 seconds after they are created
    <li>POWERTABLE</li>
    </ul>
</li>  
<li>Regions supporting write-behind activities
    <ul>
    This region is hooked configured in the WAN gateway so that any notes saved to it are asynchronously logged.  
    This shows where database persistense code would go if you wanted to do database write-behind.  The timeouts
    and batch sizes for the WAN gateway are configured in their XML file.
    <li>NOTES-REGION-WITH-GATEWAY</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>Regions for future demonstrations.
    <ul>
    Other regions exist in the config to show alternate cache configurations including disk-persistent or partitioned regions.
    <li>NOTES-ON-DISK</li>
    </ul>
</li>  
</ul>

<h2>Data Model</h2>
Data model objects exist for the Data Model Regions. They all have single attribute keys.  
This isn't a requirement but simplifies the demonstration.
<p>
Arbitrary, not necessarily uniform, or primitive data is stored in the other regions.  
Properties only include strings in the demo but they could be arbitrary property model objects.
